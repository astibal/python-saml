A library for supporting the SAML2 HTTP-POST-SimpleSign binding.

Only supporting SimpleSign allows us to provide a SAML2 SP, using only the 
standard library, and M2Crypto for signature verification. The IdP SSO Binding
is currently only HTTP-Redirect.

This has been tested against SAML2 IdPs, including shibboleth. When using
shibboleth, responses must be always be signed. XMLsig signatures are ignored.
